# **Efficient Strategies for Syncing via JDBC to Databricks Delta Lake**
Synchronizing database records into Databricks Delta Lake can be a challenging task, especially when there is no straightforward way to read from a JDBC source as a stream. 

This blog explores two effective approaches to sync data while ensuring that newly modified records are identified and can be processed or sent to an external system. We assume that transaction log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) tools like Oracle GoldenGate or AWS DMS are unavailable, either due to lack of access to the transaction log,  because we are querying from a view or any other object that can't be data captured using a commit log. 

Below, we outline two approaches to achieve this synchronization, along with considerations for reading the data, and options for running the pipeline continuously.

### **Considerations for Data Ingestion**
Before diving into the approaches, it's crucial to assess the structure and characteristics of your source data. Key factors include:
1. **Primary Key Column**: 
   - Does the source data have a primary key column?
   - If so, this can be used to merge records efficiently.
   - If not, the first approach (merging records) will not be applicable.
2. **Distribution Column**:
   - Is there a column that can be used to distribute records uniformly?
   - This column does not necessarily need to be unique but should allow for even distribution across partitions.

With these factors in mind, let's explore the two approaches:
---
### **Approach 1: Merging Records with a Last Updated Date Column**
This approach is ideal when you have a primary key column in your source data. The strategy involves:
1. **Adding a Last Updated Date Column**:
   - Add a `last_updated_date` column to the source data if it doesn't already exist.
   - This column will be used to track when each record was last modified.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for subtracting dataframes here
```

2. **Merge Logic**:
   - Use the `MERGE INTO` operation provided by Delta Lake to update existing records and insert new ones.
   - If a record exists in the Delta table with the same primary key, it is updated; otherwise, it is inserted as a new record.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for subtracting dataframes here
```

3. **Handling Deleted Records**:
   - Incorporate logic to identify and delete records that have been removed from the source.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for merging records here
```

### **Approach 2: Subtracting Dataframes**
This approach is useful when you either lack a primary key column or prefer to work with the entire dataset in each run:
1. **Loading the Full Dataset**:
   - Load the full dataset from the source database into a DataFrame.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for subtracting dataframes here
```

2. **Subtracting Dataframes**:
   - Compare the new DataFrame with the previous one to identify newly added or modified records.
   - Use the `subtract` method to find the difference between the current and previous datasets.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for subtracting dataframes here
```

3. **Processing the Changes**:
   - Newly identified changes can then be processed, sent to an external system, or stored in the Delta table.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for subtracting dataframes here
```
---
### **Running the Pipeline**
Once the data pipeline is set up using one of the above approaches, you can run it either in batch mode or as a continuous process:
1. **Batch Mode with Continuous Schedule**:
   - Schedule the pipeline to run at regular intervals (e.g., every hour) to ensure the Delta table is regularly updated.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for running the pipeline here
```
2. **Continuous Mode Using Spark Streaming**:
   - Use Spark Streaming with a rate source to continuously process data, ensuring that changes are captured in near real-time.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
# Insert code for running the pipeline here
```

### **Conclusion**
Synchronizing data from a database into Delta Lake in Databricks requires careful consideration of the data's structure and available columns. By using either a merge strategy or subtracting DataFrames, you can effectively manage and identify changes in your dataset, allowing you to keep your Delta table up-to-date and ready for further processing. 

The choice of whether to run the pipeline in batch or continuous mode depends on your specific use case and performance requirements.
